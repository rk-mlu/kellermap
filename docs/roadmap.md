# Roadmap

The project follows an incremental development strategy. Every milestone should
leave the repository in a fully functional, typed, formatted, and tested state.

# Version 0.1

## Sparse polynomial core

Adopt `sympy.polys.rings.PolyRing` as the canonical internal representation.
General SymPy expressions remain the public input and output format.

### PolynomialMap

- expression-level constructor using `sring`
- direct `from_ring()` construction for internal algorithms
- private sparse `PolyElement` coordinates
- defensive copying at mutable boundaries
- simultaneous composition with `PolyElement.compose()`
- sparse partial derivatives
- determinant through `DomainMatrix`
- degree and order from monomial exponent tuples
- displacement and filtration degree (`MA^d`)
- stable extension without expression expansion
- collision-safe temporary variable names

### Backend validation

- preserve all existing `PolynomialMap` tests
- add tests for PolyRing construction and conversion
- add tests for symbolic coefficient domains such as `k[T]`
- test composition across compatible coefficient domains
- reject non-polynomial coordinate functions at construction
- test defensive copies of mutable `PolyElement` objects
- compare small Jacobians and determinants with expression-based results
- cross-check the Schur-complement path against `DomainMatrix` at full size

### Determinant strategy

Select the determinant algorithm from the structure of the Jacobian. Where a
subset of coordinates spans a unipotent block `I + L` -- which stable
extensions, elementary automorphisms and BCW-reduced maps always produce --
the determinant reduces to the Schur complement of that block.

The unipotence precondition is decided on the dependency graph, not by taking
powers, and it is checked rather than assumed: the block identity needs
`det(D) = 1`, and an empty head block would otherwise report determinant one
for any map at all.

`DomainMatrix` over the polynomial-ring domain remains the fallback and the
reference against which the optimized path is cross-checked.

### ElementaryAutomorphism

`ElementaryFactor` is a generator of `EA_n(k)` in the sense of BCW p. 304:
`X_j |-> X_j + P` with `P` free of `X_j`, no coefficient on `X_j`. The inverse
is `X_j |-> X_j - P`, read off the definition. `ElementaryAutomorphism` is an
element of the group, kept as the ordered product of its factors.

Every generator has determinant one, hence so does every element. Admitting a
scaling `a X_j + P` would put elements of other determinant into `EA_n(k)` and
break the argument that a reduction step preserves the Jacobian determinant;
scalings belong to the linear part that Section 4 handles separately, and if
they are ever needed they get their own type.

Both operate in an existing ring and avoid expression conversions inside
reduction loops: `apply_to()` touches the single coordinate that moves.

### VariableFactory

An injectable, collision-safe name generator for stable extensions, in
`bcw.variables`. `PolynomialMap.extend()` takes one and falls back to
`DEFAULT_VARIABLE_FACTORY`.

A factory must be a pure function of ring and count. The monoid-homomorphism
invariant

    (F o G)^[m] = F^[m] o G^[m]

reaches `extend()` through three separate calls, and a factory that counted
upwards would name the sides differently and break the identity silently. The
invariant test passes a factory explicitly rather than relying on
equal-dimensional maps happening to agree.

`IndexedVariableFactory` reads the naming convention off the existing
generators, so `x1, ..., x17` extends by `x18, x19` instead of `X18, X19`.
`extend()` rechecks count, type, distinctness and collisions rather than
trusting the factory, because `PolyRing.clone()` accepts a duplicated
generator name without complaint.

The wider `ReductionContext` stays in 0.2, where the objects that determine
its requirements are built. It inherits the purity requirement: per-step
naming means handing out a fresh pure factory per step, not carrying one that
remembers.

### Release engineering

- a `LICENSE` file shipped in both wheel and sdist
- Python classifiers covering the whole supported range, not just the newest
- `make test-minimum` against the lowest permitted dependency versions
- `make build-test` running the suite against the installed wheel, so that
  packaging faults surface before a user meets them
- a CI matrix over both ends of `requires-python`

### Quality

- complete unit tests
- immutable SymPy objects across the whole public boundary, including
  `matrix` and `jacobian()`
- no mutable low-level object shared with a caller: rings are cloned on the
  way in and on the way out, through `clone_ring()` rather than SymPy's
  memoised `PolyRing.clone()`
- mypy strict mode, and a `py.typed` marker so that the annotations reach
  consumers rather than stopping at the project boundary
- mypy strict mode
- ruff and mypy targeting the lower bound from `requires-python`, so that
  the static tools guard the oldest supported version rather than the
  newest; the test matrix covers the rest
- ruff (`ruff check` and `ruff format`; black was dropped in favour of a
  single formatter)
- a `slow` pytest marker so that long-running exact checks stay in the suite
  instead of being disabled by an environment variable
- API documentation in `docs/api.md`, with every example executed by the
  test suite so that the reference cannot drift from the implementation

# Version 0.2

## Verification framework

Introduce

- `BCWStep`
- `Reduction`
- `ReductionContext` (building on the `VariableFactory` from 0.1)

Implement

```
BCWStep.verify()
```

Verification checks

- the polynomial identity

      F' = G ∘ F[m] ∘ H

- explicit invertibility of the elementary factors,
- required filtration levels,
- equality of Jacobian determinants as a consistency check.

All verification arithmetic is carried out in one shared `PolyRing` whenever
possible. At this point the project can produce machine-verifiable local proof
certificates.

---

# Version 0.3

## BCW reduction

Implement

- degree reduction,
- elementary transformations,
- stable extension,
- homogenization and unipotent reduction,
- complete reduction pipeline.

Goal:

Produce fully verified reductions for examples from the literature without
recomputing global invariants that follow from the certified local steps.

---

# Version 0.4

## Selection heuristics and scientific benchmarks

Develop heuristics for choosing reduction steps.

Tasks:

- candidate generation,
- ranking heuristics,
- search strategies,
- pruning,
- term-growth prediction,
- dimension-growth tracking.

Benchmark against published reductions of the current reference examples.
Reproducing known dimensions with machine-verifiable certificates is the first
correctness target. Improving them is a secondary scientific goal.

This milestone targets research results rather than user-interface features.

---

# Version 0.5

## Performance engineering

Profile the complete reduction pipeline and optimize only measured bottlenecks.

Possible work:

- power caching during repeated composition,
- further determinant strategies beyond the unipotent-block case of 0.1,
- fraction-free or modular determinant algorithms,
- parallel candidate evaluation,
- memory-aware term storage,
- reduced conversion at certificate boundaries.

Evaluate optional acceleration through python-flint or Singular only if the
PolyRing benchmarks demonstrate that pure SymPy cannot reach the target
problem sizes. Any accelerator must preserve the PolyRing-level mathematical
semantics and certificate format.

---

# Version 0.6

## Complete verification and benchmark framework

- large-scale regression tests,
- reproducible benchmark runner,
- machine-readable benchmark results,
- performance comparisons across releases,
- verified reduction certificates for large examples,
- independent certificate replay.

---

# Version 0.7

## User experience

- history and certificate inspection,
- LaTeX export,
- visualization,
- command-line improvements,
- extended documentation.

---

# Long-term Goals

- dimensions well beyond the current benchmark,
- reproducible and independently replayable reduction certificates,
- publishable heuristic and benchmark results,
- optional accelerated arithmetic without changing certificate semantics,
- automated verification of complete BCW reductions.
